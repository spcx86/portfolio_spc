# Why I'm Transitioning from Unicorns to Early-Stage Startups

My tech journey has taken me through some impressive companies - Razorpay, Rippling, and ShareChat. While these firms are still considered startups in many ways, they're more akin to adolescent unicorns than newborn foals. I'm grateful for these experiences, but I've realized it's time for a new challenge. Let me explain why I'm ready to trade my unicorn saddle for a seat on an early-stage startup rocket.

## Beyond Post-Unicorn Environments

Working for these successful startups has been an incredible learning experience. I've gained insights into scaling operations, managing rapid growth, and navigating the challenges that come with success. However, I've primarily been a feature contributor, adding to and refining existing systems rather than building from the ground up.

Don't get me wrong – I've enjoyed my work and learned a lot. But by the time I joined these companies, many of the foundational innovations were already in place. I was enhancing existing products rather than creating entirely new ones.

## Building from Scratch

At this stage in my career, I'm eager to be part of something from its earliest stages. I want to contribute to shaping a company's future from day one, not just add features to an already successful product. 

This desire stems from a long-term goal: in about 5 years, I see myself potentially starting my own company or playing a crucial role in a fledgling venture that's working to make a real impact. The experience of building something from the ground up is crucial for this aspiration.

## Wearing Multiple Hats

One of the main draws of an early-stage startup for me is the opportunity to wear multiple hats. In my previous roles, I often felt constrained by the specialized nature of my position. For instance, at ShareChat, I once had an idea for a feature that could significantly boost user engagement. However, by the time it went through various departments and approval processes, it had transformed into something quite different from my original vision.

What I'm craving is the ability to take an idea from conception to implementation more directly. In a small startup, if I identify a need for a new feature or product, I can be involved in every step of bringing it to life – from initial design to coding to deployment.

I thrive when I can see the direct impact of my work across multiple areas. Give me a problem, and I'll approach it from various angles – as a product manager defining the issue, as an engineer solving it, and perhaps even considering the marketing aspects. This multifaceted approach is something I believe I can bring to an early-stage startup.

## The Human-Sized Company

There's a concept called Dunbar's number, which suggests there's a cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships – about 150. Coincidentally, this is often around the size where a company starts to feel less like a close-knit group and more like a corporation.

I'm looking for a workplace where I can know everyone's name and their role in our shared mission. I want to be in an environment where every victory feels like a team achievement, and every challenge is an opportunity for the whole group to innovate together.

## All In

Ultimately, I'm ready to fully commit myself to building something from the ground up. The prospect of taking on diverse responsibilities, tackling novel problems, and creating something meaningful through collaborative effort truly excites me. I'm prepared to bring all of my experience and enthusiasm to a nascent team that's still charting its course.

## Eyes Wide Open

I'm well aware of the challenges that come with joining an early-stage startup. The long hours, the uncertainty, the potential for failure – these are all factors I've carefully considered. But here's the thing: I'm all in. The potential for failure doesn't deter me; it motivates me to work harder and smarter.

I'm betting on myself, on my abilities, and on the collective power of a passionate team. The comfort of a established tech job pales in comparison to the thrill of building something meaningful from scratch. So yes, I know the risks, and I'm still saying: count me in. Let's create something extraordinary.

To the early-stage startups out there, particularly in the realms of AI, blockchain, or sustainable tech (my areas of keen interest): I'm eager to bring my experience, drive, and unwavering commitment to your team. Let's work together to build something truly impactful.

*P.S. To potential employers: While I'm deeply serious about contributing to your company's growth, I also bring a positive attitude and creative thinking to the table. I'm looking forward to the possibility of putting these skills to work for your team, and maybe even sharing a laugh or two along the way.*
