# Tubetrotter: My Accidental Deep Dive into Travel Vlog Mapping

Look, I never planned to map out the entire world of travel vlogs. But here I am, knee-deep in YouTube APIs and geographical coordinates, all because I couldn't sleep one night and decided to watch some British panel shows. Funny how these things happen, right?

Before I dive into this saga, let me set the stage: Tubetrotter isn't just another projectâ€”it's my first solo venture that's actually made it out into the wild. Sure, I've worked on public projects before, but always as part of a team, safely tucked away in the machinery of a company. This time, it's all me. No safety net, no team to bounce ideas off, just my sleep-deprived brain and a weird idea that wouldn't let go. And somehow, miraculously, it didn't crash and burn on takeoff. So buckle up, because this is the story of how my late-night coding session turned into a full-fledged web app that people actually use.

## The Accidental Beginning

It was just another night of me procrastinating sleep by watching "Would I Lie to You?" when Lee Mack pulled out this ridiculous map of petrol stations he'd supposedly visited. It was obviously a lie, but it got me thinking - what if I had a map of all the places I've been?

Reality check: my travel history was about as exciting as watching paint dry. But you know who does travel? YouTube vloggers. And just like that, at 2 AM, fueled by insomnia and an idea that wouldn't let go, Tubetrotter was born.

## The "I Can't Believe This Worked" Prototype

Two hours later, I had a Google Map with five random videos pinned to it. It wasn't pretty, but it existed, which was more than I could say for most of my 2 AM ideas. This quick win was probably the only reason I didn't abandon the project immediately. Past me, thanks for that.

## The "What Was I Thinking?" Phase

Excited by my prototype, I decided to map out videos from two of my favorite travel vloggers: Bald and Bankrupt, and Harald Baldr. Sounds simple, right? Well, past me thought so too.

I created a browser extension to add videos to my database. The process? Watch a video, figure out where it was filmed, manually input the data. Repeat. After about 300 videos, I was questioning all my life choices that led to this moment.

## The "There's Got to Be a Better Way" Revelation

Turns out, there was. The YouTube Data API became my new best friend, along with GPT-4 mini API for extracting location data from video titles and descriptions. Was it perfect? No. Was it better than slowly losing my mind doing everything manually? Absolutely.

## The "People Actually Like This?" Moment

When I finally worked up the courage to share Tubetrotter on some subreddits, the response was... well, people didn't hate it. But the real surprise came when I posted on r/InternetIsBeautiful. Suddenly, people were not just liking it, but suggesting new channels to add. It was like watching my weird little project grow legs and start running.

## The "Oh No, It's Actually Working" Panic

As Tubetrotter grew to house 5-6 thousand videos across 15-20 channels, the site's performance took a nosedive. Users were selecting all available channels (because of course they were), and loading times skyrocketed. My poor server was sweating bullets trying to keep up with the data requests, and I realized my data fetching was about as optimized as a sloth running a marathon.

Being primarily a backend developer, my first instinct was to throw more backend at the problem. "I know!" I thought, "I'll use Redis caching! That'll solve everything!" Spoiler alert: it didn't.

You see, I'd already indexed my MongoDB collections properly (pat on the back for past me), which meant Redis barely made a dent. We're talking a 5% improvement on a good day. Sometimes, being a developer means spending days implementing a solution that barely moves the needle. It's humbling, really, and a stark reminder that your go-to solutions don't always fit every problem.

The actual solution came from an unexpected direction - the frontend. Browser-side caching with IndexedDB turned out to be the game-changer. It was one of those moments where you feel simultaneously clever for figuring it out and a bit dense for not considering it sooner. Frontend solutions solving backend problems? Younger me would've been shocked.

## The "People Are Weird" Realization

Thanks to PostHog analytics, I got to watch how people actually used the site. Turns out, everyone loves to zoom in and out and click randomly, probably wondering if anything was happening. A simple loading indicator made a world of difference. Who knew?

## The "Aha!" Moment

Here's where it gets interesting. I noticed users were selecting all channels, and I couldn't figure out why. Then it hit me - they were trying to find videos from their home countries. It wasn't about specific vloggers; people just wanted to see familiar places.

Implementing this feature involved a crash course in reverse geocoding and some serious head-scratching about UI design. The result? Two search options: by Channel and by Country. It felt good to solve a real problem, even if it meant admitting I didn't understand my users as well as I thought I did.

## What I've Learned (Besides Too Much About YouTube APIs)

1. Sometimes, insomnia leads to good ideas. Not often, but sometimes.
2. Start building before you talk yourself out of it.
3. If you're doing something manually more than 10 times, automate it. Your future self will thank you.
4. User feedback is gold, even when it makes you question your entire approach.
5. Performance optimization is never done. It's just waiting to surprise you later.
6. Users will always find a way to use your app that you never intended. Roll with it.
7. Full-stack development is just solving puzzles all day, every day.

## What's Next?

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. Tubetrotter has grown from a late-night idea into something people actually use, which is both exciting and terrifying. There's still so much I want to do with it, but for now, I'm just enjoying the ride.

This project has been a journey of "I have no idea what I'm doing" to "I have some idea what I'm doing, maybe." It's been frustrating, rewarding, and everything in between. But most importantly, it's been one hell of a learning experience.

So yeah, that's the story of Tubetrotter so far. If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking around. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a bug to fix that's been driving me crazy for days. Wish me luck!
