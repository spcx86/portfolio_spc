I&rsquo;m a software engineer and CEO of Vercel. I&rsquo;m originally
from Lan√∫s, Buenos Aires, Argentina. I owe much of my career to the Web
and Open Source.

I spent my early teens advocating for and teaching people how to use
Linux and later developed a passion for JavaScript and Web development.

After joining the [MooTools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MooTools)
core team, I got my first full-time job as a frontend engineer at 18
years old and relocated to San Francisco, CA.

I started my first company Cloudup in SF which was [later acquired by Automattic](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/25/automattic-acquires-file-sharing-service-cloudup-to-build-faster-media-library-and-enable-co-editing/),
the company behind WordPress, to power their editing and site building
technology.

After being involved in creating numerous influential open source
projects like [Socket.IO](https://socket.io) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com),
I saw the opportunity in creating tooling and cloud infrastructure to
make the Web faster, with a focus on developer experience (DX).

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) were born. Our platform now helps power the online presence of companies
like Washington Post, Porsche, Under Armour and Nintendo.

## Technical contributions

- I contributed to [MooTools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MooTools) as part of their core team and led the development of the MooTools Forge package repository.
- Authored one of the first books on Node.js ([&ldquo;Smashing Node.js: JavaScript Everywhere&rdquo;](https://www.amazon.com/Smashing-Node-js-JavaScript-Guillermo-Rauch/dp/1119962595)), after identifying the potential for JS to run on both server and client.
